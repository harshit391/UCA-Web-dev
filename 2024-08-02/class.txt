The Website Basically built using only HTML CSS and JS

All the Code Compilation happened at Application Layer

Frontend - Presentation Layer
Middleware - Application Layer
Backend - Transport Layer

Flow Control :-

From the very first point the Front end comes into light which requests the data from backend
It do not reveal the data just request the data
Front end do not control the data base neither it directly talk to data base
Nextjs can because It has both the things

The Interaction between Front end and back end happend through Application Layer

Front end first goes to Application Layer through API

Then Application Layer send the request further to Data base

So We can say Application Layer is a server ( Only as an example )
Server :- Something which serves something to us
Or Something which is fulfilling our request and giving something to us

First Front end is client to Application Layer 
Then Application Layer act as client from Data Base

All the logical things like conversion of data into required data perform at Application Layer

Why Data Base is a Server ?
Because it serving the data to us

Blocking Mode - If some instruction is executing then rest of the operations will not work ( Synchronous )
Non Blocking Mode - Opposite of Blocking Mode ( Asynchronous )

Asynchronous is the feature of browser not the java script
javascript if single threaded not multithreaded
